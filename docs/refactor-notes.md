# Refactor Notes

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup and refactoring performed on the DocScanPro React Native app to remove unused code and dependencies, improve TypeScript typing, and consolidate utilities while maintaining the exact same user experience and functionality.

## Current PDF Pipeline
The PDF export pipeline uses `pdf-lib` (pure JavaScript) and follows this process:
1. **Image Processing**: Images are processed through the FilterProcessor with filters (color/grayscale/bw) and rotation applied using react-native-image-filter-kit when available
2. **PDF Creation**: The processed image URIs are read as base64 strings and embedded into a PDF using `pdf-lib`
3. **Embedding Strategy**: Tries to embed as JPG first, then PNG, and if both fail, re-encodes the image to JPEG using react-native-image-resizer
4. **Storage**: PDF is saved to the device's document directory and shared using react-native-share
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with fallbacks ensures robust PDF generation

The pipeline maintains all original functionality including filter application, rotation, OCR integration, and sharing capabilities.

## Changes Made

### Removed Packages
- `react-native-pdf-lib` - Replaced by pdf-lib, was unused
- `@react-native/new-app-screen` - Unused component
- `@react-navigation/native` - Not used in the simple screen state management
- `@react-navigation/native-stack` - Not used
- `date-fns` - Unused utility library
- `nativewind` - Unused styling framework
- `react-native-draggable-flatlist` - Unused component
- `react-native-safe-area-context` - **Kept**: Required for SafeAreaProvider and SafeAreaView components used in App.tsx for proper safe area handling
- `react-native-screens` - Not used in the navigation system
- `react-native-view-shot` - Unused screenshot utility
- `zustand` - Unused state management library

### Removed Files
- `src/screens/Home.tsx` - Unused home screen component
- `src/components/FilteredImage.js` - Unused image filter component

### New Files
- `src/utils/log.ts` - Centralized logging utility that no-ops in release builds
- `src/utils/paths.ts` - Consolidated path utility functions

### Code Improvements
- **Logging**: Replaced all `console.log` statements with centralized logging utility
- **TypeScript Types**: Improved type safety throughout the codebase:
  - Better typing for ImageResizer results
  - More specific types for PDF operations
  - Stronger typing for native event handlers
- **Path Utilities**: Consolidated duplicate path handling functions into a single location
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Applied code formatting and fixed linting issues

### Function Signature Changes
- None - all existing APIs remain unchanged

### Safe Changes Rationale
- All removed dependencies were confirmed unused via `npx depcheck` and manual code inspection
- Removed files were not imported anywhere in the codebase
- Path utility consolidation maintains backward compatibility
- TypeScript improvements use more specific types without changing behavior
- Logging changes only affect development output, not functionality

## Verification Steps
To verify the build works correctly after these changes:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. **iOS Build**:
   ```bash
   cd ios && pod install
   npx react-native run-ios
   ```

3. **Android Build**:
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

4. **Test Core Flow**:
   - Tap "New scan" → should land in editor with visible preview
   - Tap "Run OCR" → should show spinner → success message with text persisted
   - Tap "Back" → should return to library
   - Long-press document in library OR tap trash in editor → delete → back to library
   - Filter chips should toggle with visual selected state
   - Tap "Export PDF & Share" → should show share sheet with exported PDF

## Why We Keep Safe Area Context
React Native's built-in `SafeAreaView` provides basic safe area handling, but `react-native-safe-area-context` offers more comprehensive and reliable safe area management:

- **SafeAreaProvider**: Provides safe area context to the entire app, ensuring consistent safe area calculations
- **Enhanced SafeAreaView**: Offers more precise control with `edges` prop for specifying which edges to apply safe area insets
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensures proper safe area handling on both iOS and Android with notch/dynamic island support
- **Future-Proof**: Better compatibility with newer iOS versions and device form factors

The package was initially flagged as unused by dependency analysis, but manual inspection revealed it's actively used in `App.tsx` for proper safe area handling throughout the application.

## Future Considerations
- Consider upgrading to supported TypeScript version for better ESLint compatibility
- The FilterProcessor inline styles could be extracted to StyleSheet for better performance
- Consider adding unit tests for the new utility functions
